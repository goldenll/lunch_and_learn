# README

We would like to see a README file included in your project that outlines the learning goals, how someone can clone and set up your application and where they can get their own API keys, and happy path endpoint use.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
